# 🪙 Gold Miner – Unity Game Project

A Unity 2D game where the player controls a rotating claw to grab items like gold, rocks, and diamonds. The goal is to reach the target score before time runs out.

## 🎮 Gameplay Features

- Rotating claw that grabs items when the spacebar is pressed
- Different item types (gold, rock, diamond) with varying scores and weights
- Boosters and bombs to affect gameplay
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty
- Game timer, level goals, and UI menus

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Unity Engine (2D)
- C#
- ScriptableObjects for item configuration
- Custom game manager, level manager, and booster system
- Event/delegate system for modular logic

## 👨‍💻 My Contribution

Although this project was done in collaboration, I led most of the development:
- Designed and implemented the core game mechanics in C#
- Created the item system using ScriptableObjects and weight logic
- Handled UI menus, timer, level transitions, and boosters
- Used events and clean design patterns for modularity
